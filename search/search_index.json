It should work on any Debian-based system. Get the code \u00b6 git clone https://github.com/HyphaApp/hypha.git [your-site-directory] Basic installation steps. \u00b6 These are the basic packages needed before you can start the installation process. python3-pip and python3-venv - install using sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv postgresql version 12.x version 12.x use sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-server-dev-12 to install nodejs version v16.x version v16.x , use nodesource. Add the PPA to your sources list by running this script: curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash - then sudo apt-get install nodejs Python virtual environment \u00b6 Create the virtual environment, specify the python binary to use and the directory. Then source the activate script to activate the virtual environment. The last line tells Django what settings to use. $ python3 -m venv venv/hypha $ source venv/hypha/bin/activate $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hypha.settings.production Inside your activated virtual environment you will use plain python and pip commands. Everything inside the virtual environment is python 3 since we specified that when we created it. Install Python packages \u00b6 Next, install the required packages using: $ pip install -r requirements.txt Install Node packages \u00b6 All the needed Node packages are listed in package.json . Install them with this command. $ npm install The Postgres database \u00b6 Postgresql is the database used. Start the server you installed above using sudo service postgresql start , then log into the postgres superuser, sudo su - postgres and enter the postgresql cli with psql . In the CLI, use these commands: CREATE DATABASE hypha; CREATE USER [linux username] WITH SUPERUSER LOGIN; Also, make sure that this user has trust access in pg_hba.conf. These settings can be restricted later as required. Running the app \u00b6 The application needs a secret key: export SECRET_KEY='SOME SECRET KEY HERE' . To begin with, set the export SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=false to prevent SSL redirect. When you've set up SSL for your server, you can change that setting later. Then use the following commands to test run the server: npm run build python manage.py collectstatic --noinput python manage.py createcachetable python manage.py migrate --noinput python manage.py clear_cache --cache=default --cache=wagtailcache python manage.py createsuperuser python manage.py wagtailsiteupdate server.domain apply.server.domain 80 python manage.py runserver runs development server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) runs development server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) You should see the home page of the server. That's great. You can stop the server, and then we can then take the next steps. Deploy with nginx/gunicorn \u00b6 Make sure gunicorn is installed it should be it should be . Do a test run with gunicorn: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:<some port> hypha.wsgi:application This might not work. It's OK if it doesn't work - you can go on anyway. To make gunicorn start automatically with systemd see https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html#systemd . Set up DNS so that server.domain and apply.server.domain point to the server you've installed the application. Install nginx if you haven't already sudo apt-get install nginx <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code> . You'll need to add two new config files for nginx in /etc/nginx/sites-available: public server { listen 80; server_name server.domain; client_max_body_size 2621440; location /media/ { alias /path/to/application/hypha/media/; } location /static/ { alias /path/to/application/hypha/static/; } location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock; } } apply server { listen 80; server_name apply.server.domain; client_max_body_size 2621440; location /media/ { alias /path/to/application/hypha/media/; } location /static/ { alias /path/to/application/hypha/static/; } location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock; } } The client_max_body_size configuration directive is very important. Hypha uploads files to the server in 2.5MB chunks. However, by default, nginx limits uploads to 1MB chunks. The result is that users of a Hypha system running \"behind\" nginx will see file upload failures for any file larger than 1MB. Using the client_max_body_size directive in the nginx server context is, therefore, required to make it possible for users to upload files that are bigger than 1MB in size. Symbolically link these to sites-enabled: sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/public /etc/nginx/sites-enabled && sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/apply /etc/nginx/sites-enabled . Then restart nginx using sudo systemctl restart nginx . You should then be able to access your application at http://server.domain and http://apply.server.domain . Adding SSL using a Let's Encrypt certificate. \u00b6 It's very easy to add SSL via a Let's Encrypt certificate. See instructions at https://certbot.eff.org . Follow the instructions, and you're done. Administration \u00b6 The Django Administration panel is connected to the 'apply' domain: so access that via http://apply.server.domain/django-admin/ use the email address and password you set in the python manage.py createsuperuser step above. step above. use the email address and password you set in the <code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code> step above. step above.

A Public and a Private location, applicant media should exist only in the Private location. This is for two reasons: This separates the site media, which is served publicly with no authentication, from the Applicant media, which has permissions checks, it reduces the risk of a miss-configured storage exposing the Applicant data. Maintains separation between the two halves of the platform, Apply and Public. Media should also be served from a view that inherits from the PrivateMediaView which will confirm that the file isn't made public and can be configured to return the file object from an authenticated view. Public site \u00b6 Security \u00b6 The Public site is intended to be a heavily cached public site with no behaviour that requires authentication, excluding the Wagtail Admin. The ultimate aim would be to serve this site statically. Coupling \u00b6 The coupling between the Public and Apply sites has been done in such as way as to minimise the interaction between the two sites and facilitate a means of separation should the need arise. Their relationship is defined in the Public fund models: BaseApplicationPage.application_type LabPage.lab_type Data: Public to Apply \u00b6 The public site relies on the apply site to provide information on the related round status, open or closed and any closing dates for the round. The majority of this is within the apply cta . Removing the database relationship and exposing the required data over an API would be all thats required to split the two sites. Data: Apply to Public \u00b6 The application_public and lab_public relations are then exposed on the application models through the detail attribute which is used to provide a link back to the public page in a few locations. References to these attributes should be kept to a minimum and could be replaced with a URL field to achieve seperation of Public and Apply portions of the project. URL configuration \u00b6 The two site have different url configurations, this limits the Apply site to a subset of the urls in the project. This is configured as part of the middleware stack using apply_url_conf_middleware . This swaps out the url configuration based on the site homepage configured in the wagtail admin. The default url configuration is for the Public site which are shared by the Public and Apply sites. The Public site has access to the \"public authentication\" urls, this enables reverse lookup of the url in templates, such as the login button , but the user is redirected to the apply site.

Everything from now on will happen inside the hypha directory. Python virtual environment \u00b6 Create the virtual environment, specify the python binary to use and the directory. Then source the activate script to activate the virtual environment. The last line tells Django what settings to use. $ python3 -m venv venv/hypha $ source venv/hypha/bin/activate $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hypha.settings.dev Inside your activated virtual environment you will use plain python and pip commands. Everything inside the virtual environment is python 3 since we specified that when we created it. Each time you open up a new shell to work with the app you will need to activate the virtual environment. $ cd /path/to/application/hypha $ source venv/hypha/bin/activate $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hypha.settings.dev Install Python packages \u00b6 All the needed python packages for production are listed in the requirements.txt file. Additional packages for development are listed in requirements-dev.txt , it also includes everything from the requirements.txt file. For a development environment you then run: $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt If any requirements*.txt file have been updated you will need to rerun this command to get the updated/added packages. Note for macOS users: If pip does not want to build \"psycopg2\" you need to add openssl to your \"LIBRARY_PATH\". Assuming you have openssl installed with homebrew the following should work. $ export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/ Install Node packages \u00b6 All the needed Node packages are listed in package.json . Install them with this command. $ npm install The Postgres database \u00b6 If the createdb and dropdb is not available you will need to add the Postgres bin directory to your path or call the commands with complete path. Create a database for the app. $ createdb hypha To drop a database use. $ dropdb hypha Linux installs might require setting up a user \u00b6 On Linux you might need to run as the \"postgres\" user first when setting up Postgres. Use it to create the database and set up a database user. For local development I suggest creating a user with the same name as your account, then you will not need to specify it on every command. $ su - postgres $ createdb hypha $ createuser [your-account-name] macOS users might need this fix \u00b6 To make the app find the Postgres socket you might need to update the \"unix_socket_directories\" setting in the postgresql.conf file. unix_socket_directories = '/tmp, /var/pgsql_socket' Use stellar for db snapshots \u00b6 If you installed \"stellar\" you can use it to take snapshots and restore them. $ stellar snapshot hypha_2019-10-01 $ stellar restore hypha_2019-10-01 Local settings \u00b6 On production it's recommended to use environment variables for all settings. For local development putting them in a file is however convenient. When you use the \"dev\" settings it will included all the setting you put in local.py . Copy the local settings example file. $ cp -p hypha/settings/local.py.example hypha/settings/local.py (It is also possible to use a local .env file since Hypha use the environs package.) You most likely want to set these: ALLOWED_HOSTS BASE_URL SECRET_KEY If you have a problem with \"CSRF cookie not set\". CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = None SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = None If you do not use the app name for the database. import dj_database_url DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.config( conn_max_age=600, default='postgres:///your_db_name' ) } Create log directory \u00b6 mkdir -p var/log/ Set up Gunicorn \u00b6 Gunicorn is installed inside the virtual environment since it's listed in requirements.txt . At the bottom of this file you find a handy script for Gunicorn. For a quick test you can run this command from your site directory. $ gunicorn hypha.wsgi:application --env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hypha.settings.dev --bind 127.0.0.1:9001 Quit the server with ctrl-c when you done testing. hypha.wsgi:application links it up to the app via the hypha/wsgi.py file. --env \u2026 tells it what settings to use, for development your want \"dev\" settings. --bind \u2026 makes it listen on localhost port 9001. Socket works as well but on macOS they have given me issues, while tcp connections always seems to just work. Set up Apache or Nginx \u00b6 Set up new vhost for Apache or Nginx. We let the web server handle static files and proxy everything else over to Gunicorn. The examples uses port 80 for web server and port 9001 for WSGI, feel free to change that if needed. You maybe are already running other services on these ports or prefer to not run the web server as root and want a port above 1024.

Here are the most common in development. This will watch all sass and js files for changes and build them with css maps. It will also run the \"collecstatic\" command, useful when running the site with a production server and not the built in dev server. $ npm run watch To build all assets for development use this command. $ npm run dev:build If you are working on the React components you also need to set \"API_BASE_URL\" to the correct value. $ export API_BASE_URL='http://apply.hypha.test/api' To build the assets which get deployed, use the following. The deployment scripts will handle this, and the files should not be committed. $ npm run build Finally, the app itself \u00b6 Start by specifying what settings file is to be used if you have not already done this, see above if you have not already done this, see above . $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hypha.settings.dev Then decide if you want to start with some demo content or with an empty db. Load the sandbox db to get some demo content \u00b6 There is a /public/sandbox_db.dump file that has some demo content to get you started. Load it in with this command. $ pg_restore --verbose --clean --if-exists --no-acl --no-owner --dbname=hypha public/sandbox_db.dump It's not always completely up to date so run: $ python manage.py migrate --noinput Or create a db from scratch. \u00b6 Create the cache tables. $ python manage.py createcachetable Run all migrations to set up the database tables. $ python manage.py migrate --noinput Create the first super user. $ python manage.py createsuperuser Collect all the static files. $ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput --settings=hypha.settings.dev (If this command complain about missing static_compiled directory, run the npm run dev:build command above first.) Set the addresses and ports of the two wagtail sites. $ python manage.py wagtailsiteupdate hypha.test apply.hypha.test 80 Now you should be able to access the sites on http://hypha.test/ and http://apply.hypha.test/ Run tests \u00b6 Hypha has specific settings for testing so specify them when you run the \"test\" command. $ python manage.py test --settings=hypha.settings.test If you need to rerun the tests several times this will speed them up considerably. $ python manage.py test --parallel --keepdb --settings=hypha.settings.test Administration \u00b6 The Apply dashboard: http://apply.hypha.test/dashboard/ The Apply Wagtail admin: http://apply.hypha.test/admin/ The Django Administration panel: http://apply.hypha.test/django-admin/ Use the email address and password you set in the createsuperuser step above to login.

What are the 4 workflows? \u00b6 Request Request with external review Request with community review Concept and proposal All workflows begin with applicant drafting, revising and submitting an application ( DRAFT_STATE ) \u2014 only transition available is to INITIAL_STATE , upon applicant taking the action to submit their application/request. Request \u00b6 The request workflow is a single stage process with no advisory council review. Proposal Persona: Funding organization offers a rapid response fund or another type of grantmaking that requires a streamline process that does not require an external review process. This application process could also be used for in-kind services like coaching, security audits, etc. Once an application is submitted ( INITIAL_STATE ) \u2014 it can transition into the following: A request for more information ( more_info ) \u2014 opens editing permissions to applicant again to revise their application to provide the information requested by the screeners. Open review ( internal_review ) \u2014 can transition only between closing review period ( post_review_discussion ) and reverting back to the internal screening phase. post_review_discussion \u2014 after review is closed, you can request more information ( post_review_more_info ), ready for determination ( determination ), revert back to opening the review ( internal_review ), accept but additional info is needed ( almost ), accept ( accepted ) or reject ( rejected ) post_review_more_info \u2014 opens editing permissions to applicant again to revise their application to provide the information requested by the reviewers.

Accepted ( accepted ) \u2014 application accepted. Staff can still edit this submission. Rejected ( rejected ) \u2014 application rejected. Permissions removed from all roles. Request with external review \u00b6 This workflow is a single stage process with an advisory council review or external review stage -- includes functionalties for external reviewers like advisory board members to access applications and submit reviews. Proposal Persona: This funding organization relies on external partners for evaluations. Proposals submitted to this workflow are reviewed by staff members and an advisory board that is made up of trusted community members. Once an application is submitted ( INITIAL_STATE ) \u2014 it can transition into the following: A request for more information ( ext_more_info ) \u2014 opens editing permissions to applicant again to revise their application to provide the information requested by the screeners.

Request with community review \u00b6 This workflow is a single stage process with an advisory council review or external review stage. Proposal Persona: This funding organization works with the community to co-design a meaningful definition of success. Applications are reviewed by staff members and an advisory board that is made up of trusted community members. Once an application is submitted ( INITIAL_STATE ) \u2014 it can transition into the following: A request for more information ( com_more_info ) \u2014 opens editing permissions to applicant again to revise their application to provide the information requested by the screeners.

Proposal Persona: This application process is continually informed by feedback from grantee partners and community members. Applicants could use the workflow to follow the trajectory of the submission process as this workflow is transparent from the concept note (first stage) all the way to the proposal (second stage) with prospective and current applicants about funding priorities and decisions. The proposal stage has functionalities for applications to be reviewed by staff members and an advisory board that is made up of trusted community members.
