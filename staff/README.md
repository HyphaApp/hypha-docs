# 🏃 Usage Guide

The examples in this document are based on Hypha's [demo site](https://sandbox.opentech.fund). However, the instructions are general enough as to be applicable to any Hypha site.

## Granting organizations' process:

1. Determine **kind of project** to be funded (e.g. grantmaking categories or thematic areas)
2. Outline **expected steps** in application process (e.g. # of stages)
3. Decide on **timeline** for application process (e.g., due dates vs. rolling)
4. Generate **questions for/information needed** from the applicant
5. Disseminate **request for proposals**
6. Specify **review criteria**
7. **Assign reviewers** to received applications
8. Review applications & **make decisions** about which projects to fund

##

## Steps in Hypha:

* First, you create **"Forms"** for:
  * _applicants_ (application forms) \[4]
  * _reviewers_ (review criteria) \[6]
  * and _determinations_ (decisions) \[8]
* Then, you create a **"Fund"** in which you:
  * Specify _expected steps_ \[2] & _reviewers_ \[7]
  * Attach the _applicant_ \[4], _reviewer_ \[6], and _determination_ \[8] **Forms**
* Next, you create a **"Round"** that associates a **Fund** with the _timeline_ \[3] for accepting applications
* Finally, you can generate a **"Page"** that hosts:
  * information about the _kind of project_ to be funded \[1]
  * the _request for proposals_ \[5] (_this may be incorporated with \[1]_)
  * a _link to apply_ (this links to the **Round**)
